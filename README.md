# GAIA-benchmark-Agentic-AI-project
Agentic AI tool for the GAIA benchmark

This repository contains the code for the final assignment of the Hugging Face course on Agentic AI. It demonstrates the capabilities of an AI Agent using the GAIA dataset.

I am still improving this code; right now, it achieves a 40% accuracy on the level 1 test cases of the GAIA benchmark.
